# 🎨 Color Switcher - DOM Project

This is a simple and interactive **JavaScript DOM project** that allows users to change the background color of a webpage by clicking on colored buttons. It's a beginner-friendly mini-project to demonstrate the usage of DOM selectors and event handling in JavaScript.

## 📁 Project Structure


## 🚀 How It Works

- The web page displays a set of colored buttons (Grey, White, Blue, Yellow, Brown).
- When a user clicks on any of these buttons, the background color of the entire page changes to the selected color.
- This is achieved using JavaScript's DOM manipulation (`querySelectorAll`, `addEventListener`, and `style.backgroundColor`).

## 🧠 Concepts Used

- HTML for structure
- CSS for styling
- JavaScript for:
  - DOM selection
  - Event handling
  - Styling changes based on user interaction

## 💡 Usage

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a browser.
3. Click on any colored square to see the background color of the page change instantly.
